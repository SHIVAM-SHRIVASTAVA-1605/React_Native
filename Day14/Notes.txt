Notifications

1. Local Notifications
 - If app is installed and on the same devuce we can schedule the notification.
 -> Remider - teells reminder on the certain time


Two ways to work with react-native
1. Expo => If using expo -> Too easy. -> Here all configuration is done in app.json
2. Bare React-Native / React-Mative CLI => Too mych configuration - here a;; he configuration is not done in the app.json

=> Notification => expo-notification
    - schedule the notification

Install
    - npx expo install expo-notification.


# Drawbacks

Local Notifications
    - App should always be running.



Push Notifications
    - Doesn't care bout app aunning status

# app publishing

1. expo cloud
    - system does not matter, we can deploy both android | ios | all

2. bare react native
    - system => windows -> android -> ios x


# React js vs Next js

1. Library of js or framework react
2. independednt, no set of rules or strict, we are not, independednt
3. react router dom, seo need more config or no extra config seo is too easy
4. folder structure or next router

# seo
